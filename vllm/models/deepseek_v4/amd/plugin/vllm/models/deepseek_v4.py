"""vLLM-specific DeepSeek-V4 model.

This module reuses the native ATOM DeepSeek-V4 implementation
(:mod:`atom.models.deepseek_v4`) unchanged and only layers on the behaviour
that vLLM's graph-mode execution requires. The single vLLM-specific concern is
reconciling the padded CUDA-graph bucket width against the sparse-attention
metadata in the graph-break attention op (see ``DeepseekV4AttentionVllm``).

It follows the same construction-swap pattern as ``qwen3_next``: the
``DeepseekV4ForCausalLM`` subclass temporarily rebinds the module-global
``DeepseekV4Attention`` so the whole model tree is built with the vLLM attention
variant, then restores it.

    """DeepSeek-V4 attention with vLLM piecewise-CUDA-graph reconciliation.

    Under ``cudagraph_mode=FULL_AND_PIECEWISE`` vLLM captures/replays the dense
    regions of ATOM's torch.compiled graph at the padded bucket width, while the
    ``deepseek_v4_attention`` op (a graph break, marked as a splitting op) runs
    eagerly. So for a prefill/mixed batch whose bucket was captured, ``x`` /
    ``positions`` arrive padded to ``T_pad``, but the sparse-attention metadata
    is built for the *real* token count (the bridge's prefill path sets
    ``batch_id_per_token`` to length == real tokens).

    Slice the inputs to the real tokens before the (unchanged) native attention
    so per-token Q rows match the ``kv_indptr`` arrays — otherwise the
    paged-prefill kernel aborts with ``kv_indptr_prefix length must be N+1`` —
    then pad the output back to ``T_pad`` so the next captured dense region (and
    this op's ``empty_like(x)`` fake-meta) see the full bucket width.

    Decode is fully captured (incl. this op) with metadata already padded to the
    bucket, so it runs at the padded width and must NOT be sliced. The padded
    rows are never sampled (``logits_indices`` reference real positions only).
